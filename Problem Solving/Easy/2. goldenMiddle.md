
2. Given are two arrays a and b, both have three elements. Return a new array of length 2 containing both middle (index 1) elements of the arrays.

function goldenMiddle(a, b) {
    // Access the element at index 1 (the middle element) from array 'a'.
    // Access the element at index 1 (the middle element) from array 'b'.
    // Create a new array directly with these two elements.
    let mid1 = [a[1], b[1]];

    // Return the newly created array.
    return mid1;
}
