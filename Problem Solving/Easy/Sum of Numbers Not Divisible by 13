Sum of Numbers Not Divisible by 13
This JavaScript program calculates the sum of all numbers between two integers X and Y (inclusive) that are not divisible by 13.

Code
javascript
function sumNonDivisibleBy13(X, Y) {
    let sum = 0;
    const start = Math.min(X, Y); // Determine the smaller number
    const end = Math.max(X, Y);   // Determine the larger number

    for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
        if (i % 13 !== 0) { // Check if the number is NOT divisible by 13
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

// Example usage:
const X = 100;
const Y = 200;
const result = sumNonDivisibleBy13(X, Y);
console.log(`Sum of numbers between ${X} and ${Y} not divisible by 13: ${result}`);
Explanation
Input Handling
The function sumNonDivisibleBy13(X, Y) takes two integers, X and Y.

Determine Range

Math.min(X, Y) ensures the loop starts from the smaller number.

Math.max(X, Y) ensures the loop runs up to the larger number.

Loop Through Numbers
The for loop iterates from start to end (inclusive).

Check Divisibility

i % 13 !== 0 checks if a number is not divisible by 13.

If true, the number is added to the sum.

Return Result
The function returns the total sum of numbers not divisible by 13.

Example Output
For X = 100 and Y = 200, the program calculates the sum of all numbers between them (inclusive) that are not divisible by 13 and logs the result:

text
Sum of numbers between 100 and 200 not divisible by 13: <result>
