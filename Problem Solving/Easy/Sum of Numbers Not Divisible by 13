# Sum of Numbers Not Divisible by 13 🧮

This JavaScript program calculates the **sum of all numbers between two integers X and Y (inclusive)** that are **not divisible by 13**.

---

## 📄 Problem Statement
Given two integers **X** and **Y**, find the sum of all integers between them (inclusive) that are **not divisible by 13**.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code

```javascript
function sumNonDivisibleBy13(X, Y) {
    let sum = 0;
    const start = Math.min(X, Y); // Determine the smaller number
    const end = Math.max(X, Y);   // Determine the larger number

    for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
        if (i % 13 !== 0) { // Check if the number is NOT divisible by 13
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

// Example usage:
const X = 100;
const Y = 200;
const result = sumNonDivisibleBy13(X, Y);
console.log(`Sum of numbers between ${X} and ${Y} not divisible by 13: ${result}`);

## 📝 Explanation

### 1. Input Handling

* The function `sumNonDivisibleBy13(X, Y)` accepts two integers: **X** and **Y**.

### 2. Determine Range

* `Math.min(X, Y)` ensures the loop starts from the smaller number.
* `Math.max(X, Y)` ensures the loop runs up to the larger number.

### 3. Loop Through Numbers

* Iterate from **start** to **end** (inclusive).

### 4. Check Divisibility by 13

* For each number `i`, check:

  ```js
  if (i % 13 !== 0)
  ```

  * If **true**, add `i` to the sum.

### 5. Return Result

* After the loop, return the total **sum** of numbers **not divisible by 13**.

## 🖥 Example Output

For **X = 100** and **Y = 200**, the program will output:

```
Sum of numbers between 100 and 200 not divisible by 13: <result>
```

(Replace `<result>` with the actual calculated value.)
