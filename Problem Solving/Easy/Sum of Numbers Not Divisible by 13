# Sum of Numbers Not Divisible by 13 🧮

This JavaScript program calculates the **sum of all numbers between two integers X and Y (inclusive)** that are **not divisible by 13**.

---

## 📄 Problem Statement
Given two integers **X** and **Y**, find the sum of all integers between them (inclusive) that are **not divisible by 13**.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code

```javascript
function sumNonDivisibleBy13(X, Y) {
    let sum = 0;
    const start = Math.min(X, Y); // Determine the smaller number
    const end = Math.max(X, Y);   // Determine the larger number

    for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
        if (i % 13 !== 0) { // Check if the number is NOT divisible by 13
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

// Example usage:
const X = 100;
const Y = 200;
const result = sumNonDivisibleBy13(X, Y);
console.log(`Sum of numbers between ${X} and ${Y} not divisible by 13: ${result}`);
